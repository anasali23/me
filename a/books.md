1. Lolita


> Aastha

1. Okay so first would be Lolita obviously because you are a writer and it’s writing is just so beautiful that I can’t put it into words also the book is great as well
2. And then if you are into spiritualism then I’d suggest you 40 rules of love. Find me a better book than this and I’ll do whatever you say. So yes
3. Then I’d give you crime and punishment which I’m currently reading because I think that I’m at the verge of becoming Dostoevsky’s protagonist idk.
4. Then I’d give you a thousand splendid suns because life isn’t great without a touch of melancholy in it. So read this and let melancholic vibes take over you.
5. Okay for that I’ll give you Hanna’s suitcase because life isn’t complete without getting the chills of world war
6. Then I’d give you 1984 because someone’s always looking at you
7. Then Sputnik sweetheart. No explanation for that. Just one hell of an amazing not really amazing book though. But it will make you feel every word of it as if the protagonist is you.
